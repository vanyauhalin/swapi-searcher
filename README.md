## About

Create a react application that will have a Home page with a Search panel and a Detail page. On the Detail page should be a search field.

The interface should be similar to google.com.

First screen: A user sees the search panel in the centre of the screen and user is able to search one of the types of the resource from API. You can make a selector for the resource type under the search field. Similar to the search panel in Google. When the user presses the “search” button he will redirect to the second screen.

Second screen: User sees the search field with a prefilled value from the first step. The search panel should be the same component from the first screen. Under the search panel, the user should see cards with all resources that return from the API.

Rest API: https://swapi.dev/

Feel free to make an optimization of the search.

Send the result with a Github link.
